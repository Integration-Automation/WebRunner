> Multiton Selenium Instance  \
> The WEB automation component is a web automation solution based on Selenium. \
> It wraps Selenium and therefore has all the functionality of Selenium. \
> What problems does it solve? 
>> * Automatically downloads and updates the required web driver, so users no longer need to install it manually.
>> * Provides the ability to simultaneously run and monitor multiple Selenium instances.
>> * Provides a keyword-based automation approach that Selenium does not have.
>> * Can produce test reports that record actions taken during the test.
>> * Can execute tests remotely through TCP/IP.
>> * Offers a CLI mode for Web automation.
